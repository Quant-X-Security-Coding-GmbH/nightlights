Nightlights is a simple webpage for the presentation of images. It is an open source project of [Quant-X Security & Coding](https://quant-x-sec.com/) to demonstrate the migration of AngularJS to Angular, caused by the end of life of AngularJS end of 2021.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
